. Install pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/
. The only `pip` requirement is `pipenv`. We wil work purely with virtual environments, at least

. When running `pre-commit`, remember to start your virtual environment with `pipenv shell`
. Do a string search and replace for `python/starter-python3-project` if you change the directory name
